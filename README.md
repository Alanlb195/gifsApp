# GifsApp Project

GifsApp is a simple and fun web application where you can search for GIFs and explore endless results powered by the GIPHY API.  
Just type any keyword in the search bar, and the app will instantly show you a collection of related GIFs.  

Your recent searches are saved as tags, so you can easily revisit them later without typing again.
